						<h3><b>FormsCentral is retiring!</b></h3>
						<p>On July 28, 2015, Adobe FormsCentral will be officially retired from service.</p>

						<p>Despite enthusiastic use of FormsCentral by many of you over the past three years, Adobe found that there hasnâ€™t been as much demand for this type of service. </p>

						<p>We are the developers of FormsCentral! It's not easy for us to leave our baby we have spent last 3 years, day and night. We want to keep it alive but we need your <b>HELP!</b></p>

						<p>FormsCentral's developers want to risk everything and create the same product with modern web technologies. We know, it will take some time to create everything from scratch, but we have done it before, and we can do it again!</p>

						<p>New FormsCentral, <b>FormsCentral.io</b> will be simple, intuitive and enjoyable like the one that Adobe shutdown. You don't need to learn a new Form Builder, do not need to move your forms to somewhere else you don't know. </p>

						<p><u>FormsCentral.io will come with new features!</u></p>
						<p>Do you want to integrate your payments with <b>Stripe</b> or <b>Dwolla</b> ? Do you need <b>HIPAA Compliance</b> ? Do you want to get your responses into your <b>Dropbox, Google Drive, or Box.com</b>? </p><p> <b>You will definitely get them! </b></p>

						<p>We're very excited about it, but before risk our lives, we want to hear from you! </p>
						<p><b> What do you think about our offer? </b></p>
						<p>Do you want to stay with us or will you try to find a new home for your forms ?</p>

						<p>Please reply and let us know your feedback,</p>
						<p>Thank you very much!</p>

						<p>- FormsCentral.io Team</p>
